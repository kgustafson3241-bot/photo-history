					<h2>The History of Early Photography</h2>

					<p>Before permanent photographs existed, artists and scientists used the <strong>Camera Obscura</strong>, meaning “dark room.” Light passed through a small opening and projected an upside-down image onto a wall or surface. Although useful for tracing images, it could not preserve them permanently.</p>

					<p>In the Early 1800s, inventors experimented with light-sensitive chemicals. The <strong>Earliest Surviving Photograph</strong> is often credited to Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, who captured an image using a very long exposure time.</p>

					<p>In 1839, the <strong>Daguerreotype</strong> was introduced, producing highly detailed images on polished metal plates. Around the same time, other methods used Paper Negatives, allowing multiple copies of a single image to be made.</p>

					<p>The biggest shift came when photography became affordable and portable. The <strong>Brownie Camera</strong>, introduced in 1900, allowed everyday families to take their own pictures. This moment transformed Photography from a scientific process into a common part of daily life.</p>
